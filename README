This is one of my previous homework assignments. 

Some of my assignments are 100% done from scratch, while others are based off of a skeleton I was provided. 
They might be useful for some of you out there, but their real intent is to document my progress... and hopefully look back and feel proud at some point?

Later assignments are 100% from scratch. This program can be compiled and ran without any supplementary files. Some of the files I will provide in HW-assignment-based repos may not include all of the files as they were included but not done by me. This was the first time I was introduced to Java after coming from python. I believe I did this one from scratch, I remember having a fun time doing this one because I had a similar program to do before and liked it the first time. It was hard to get my head around the order of the syntax, like the use of append() and how Python differs from Java.

In this folder, you will see the Conversation.java file.
